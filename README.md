# No-Show Appointment Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores a dataset containing over 100,000 medical appointments from Brazil. The dataset focuses on various patient and appointment characteristics, with a specific emphasis on whether or not a patient showed up for their scheduled appointment. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and correlations that may explain the factors contributing to no-shows.

## Data Files
1. Raw data: noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv
2. Analysis file:Data analysis project.pdf
The analysis presented in this project was originally conducted in a Jupyter Notebook and has been exported to PDF format for easy viewing.


## Key Questions Explored
1. Is there a correlation between gender and the likelihood of showing up for appointments?
2. Does receiving an SMS reminder increase the likelihood of attending an appointment?
3. Is there a relationship between the time gap between scheduling and the appointment day and the likelihood of a no-show?
4. Do patients with disabilities have a higher tendency to miss appointments?


## Conclusions
- Gender does not play a role in no-show rates.
- Longer scheduling gaps and SMS reminders are associated with higher no-show rates.
- Further study is needed to confirm the impact of disabilities due to limited data on patients with multiple disabilities.
